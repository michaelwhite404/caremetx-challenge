# Caremetx Challenge

Challenge for CareMetx

## Installing the script

1. Clone the repository from GitHub

```sh
git clone https://github.com/michaelwhite404/caremetx-challenge.git
cd caremetx-challenge
```

2. Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

3. Compile typescript code

```sh
npx tsc
```

4. Link the script

```sh
npm link
```

The command '_**caremetx**_' should now be available

_**Note: Some terminals may not allow linking to the script. If that is the case, you can run 'npm start' as opposed to 'caremetx'**_  
Ex. The command '_**caremetx test**_' can be run as '_**npm start test**_'

## Commands

The first command that should be run is the '_**caremetx connect**_' command. This is where you will add your MongoDB connection string. Then you can run the '_**caremetx**_' command. This will start the CLI to run additional scripts.
